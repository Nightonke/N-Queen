# N-Queen
Use different method to solve n_queen problem and compare the differences.

This is my course homework, from Artificial Intelligence.
>Generate a large number of 8-puzzle and 8-queens instances and solve them (where possible)
by hill climbing (steepest-ascent and first-choice variants), hill climbing with random
restart, and simulated annealing. Measure the search cost and percentage of solved problems
and graph these against the optimal solution cost. Comment on your results.

So I write this code in JAVA, for a simple test for N queen problem.
